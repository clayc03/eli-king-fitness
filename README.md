## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues. I also used [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) to test the funcionality of the website on desktop and mobile compatibility using these websites developer tools.
 
 [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was helpfull throughout the development of this website.


## Compatibility testing
* Using Lighthouse developers tools the site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices. 

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was helpfull throughout the development of this website for mobile and desktop compatibility.
 
I used a HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 11 Home throughout this project and used 2 x different monitors to connect (Samsung 24 inch and LG 27 inch). I also used my Huawei P30 Pro mobile to check the sites compatibility.

I used the [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) website to see if there is any color contrast errors. 

Below is a screenshot of the Plans & Prices page who had the only contrast error for the website, I changed the background from lightblue to lightcyan to correct this error.
